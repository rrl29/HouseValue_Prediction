# House-Value-Prediction
This project is based on"California Housing Data-set". The project involved preprocessing on the data,and then performing a comparative study of different algorithms. We have used standard functions for pipelines and adder functions.
We have applied algorithms on the data-set, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forrest and Gradient Boosting.
